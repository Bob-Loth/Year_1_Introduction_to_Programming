1. Objective: create overUnder3-algorithm.txt to keep a list of every user guess and output a message if the user guesses a
number already guessed. use an array-based list to check.

2. Requirements
INPUT: userGuess, integer between 1 and 100 to guess a random number


PROCESSING:
create a random number between 1 and 100
create an array-based list
get user input to guess a number, if that number is already on the array-based list then tell them
save that number to the array-based list if is not already on the list
if the guess is lower than the rnadom number then output that it is too low, and return to get user input
if the guess is higher than the rnadom number then output that it is too high, and return to get user input
if the guess is correct, tell them it is correct and end program


OUTPUT: tooHighPrompt
        tooLowPrompt
        correctGuessPrompt

DATA: 
arrayGuess
tooHighPrompt
tooLowPrompt
correctGuessPrompt



3. Instructions
10 create a random number between 1 and 100
20 create an array-based list
30 get user input to guess a number, if that number is already on the array-based list then tell them
40 save that number to the array-based list if is not already on the list
50 if the guess is lower than the rnadom number then output that it is too low, and return to 30
60 if the guess is higher than the rnadom number then output that it is too high, and return to 30
70 if the guess is correct, tell them it is correct and end program




4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: Wide variety of characters, lines without characters     and  Input values if any: secrets.txt encoded version of threeQuestions.cpp
