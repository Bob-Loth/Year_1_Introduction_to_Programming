Name: Robert Loth
Course: COMSC-110-1021

1. Objective: create overUnder3-algorithm.txt to keep a list of every user guess and output a message if the user guesses a
number already guessed. use an array-based list to check.

2. Requirements
INPUT: userGuess, integer between 1 and 100 to guess a random number


PROCESSING:
create a random number between 1 and 100
create an array-based list
get user input to guess a number, if that number is already on the array-based list then tell them
save that number to the array-based list if is not already on the list
if the guess is lower than the rnadom number then output that it is too low, and return to get user input
if the guess is higher than the rnadom number then output that it is too high, and return to get user input
if the guess is correct, tell them it is correct and end program


OUTPUT: tooHighPrompt
        tooLowPrompt
        correctGuessPrompt

DATA: 
array- guess
string- tooHighPrompt when user's guess is higher than correct guess
string- tooLowPrompt when user's guess is lower than correct guess
string- correctGuessPrompt when user guesses correctly
int- i for index


3. Instructions
10 create a random number between 1 and 100
20 create an array-based list
30 get user input to guess a number, if that number is already on the array-based list then tell them, and ask for input again
40 save that number to the array-based list if is not already on the list
50 if the guess is lower than the random number then output that it is too low, and return to 30
60 if the guess is higher than the random number then output that it is too high, and return to 30
70 if the guess is correct, tell them it is correct and end program




4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: too high, then duplicate answer1, then too low, then duplicate answer1, then duplicate answer2, then correct
Input values if any: correctGuess = 40, userGuess = 60, 60, 20, 60, 20, 40

10 correctGuess = 40
20 guess[100] = {empty for now}
30 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. userGuess = 60, is not on list
40 guess[0] = 60
50 false
60 true - Too high, guess again
30 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. userGuess = 60, is on list userGuess[0]=60 - Guess again, you already guessed 60
30 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. userGuess = 20, is not on list 
40 guess[1] = 20
50 true - too low, guess again
30 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. userGuess = 60 is on list userGuess[0] = 60 - Guess again, you already guessed 60
30 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. userGuess = 20 is on list userGuess[1] = 20 - Guess again, you already guessed 20
30 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. userGuess = 40 is not on list 
40 guess[2] = 40
50 false
60 false
70 true, "You did it!"
