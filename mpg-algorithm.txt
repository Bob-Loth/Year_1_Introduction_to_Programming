1. Objective: get keyboard input from the user to calculate the miles/gallon. 
Depending on the capacity in gallons of the fuel tank calculate the range possible with the remaining fuel.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
Miles of the trip
total capacity of the fuel tank
the amount of fuel in gallons in the fuel tank, after the trip

PROCESSING:
get keyboard input for miles, capacity, and fuel remaining, store as miles, capacity, and gallons respectively
divide miles by (capacity minus gallons), store result as mpg
multiply mpg by gallons, store as range
output mpg and range with appropriate labels

OUTPUT:
Miles per gallon
Range possible with the remaining fuel

DATA:
miles // distance in miles of the trip
range // the maximum range of the car with the fuel remaining in the tank
capacity // total capacity of the fuel tank
gallons // the amount of fuel, in gallons, in the fuel tank, after the trip
 mpg // miles per gallon that the vehicle got during the trip
  

3. Instructions
10 ask for trip distance in miles, store as miles
15 validate input: miles must be >0, if not display error message and return to 10
20 ask for gallons currently in tank, store as gallons
25 validate input: gallons must be >0, if not display error message and return to 20
30 ask for total capacity of the fuel tank, store as capacity
35 validate input, capacity must be more than gallons and >0, if not display error message and return to 30
40 divide miles by (capacity minus gallons), store as mpg
50 multiply mpg by gallons, store as range
60 output mpg and range with appropriate labels




4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: regular test case using valid input   and  Input values if any: miles = 60 capacity = 10 gallons = 7 Expected returns: mpg = 20 Range = 140
10 miles = 20
15 true
20 gallons = 7
25 true
30 capacity = 10
35 true, true
40 mpg = 60 / (10-7) = 60/3 = 20
50 range = 7 * 20 = 140
60 "You got 20.00 miles per gallon during that trip." "With your current fuel reserve, you can travel an additional 140.00 miles before needing to refuel."

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: invalid numbers, checking return points   and  Input values if any: miles = 0, 1(second time) capacity = 4 gallons = 5, 2(second time) Expected returns: error message at 15, error message at 35, then mpg= range=.
10 miles = 0
15 false "Miles travelled must be greater than 0"
10 miles = 1
15 true
20 capacity = 4
25 true
30 gallons = 5
35 false, true "Gallons remaining in the tank must be less than the capacity of the tank."
30 gallons = 2
35 true, true
40 mpg = 1 / (4-2) = 1/2
50 range = 2 * 1/2 = 1
60 "You got 0.50 miles per gallon during that trip." "With your current fuel reserve, you can travel an additional 1.00 miles before needing to refuel."
