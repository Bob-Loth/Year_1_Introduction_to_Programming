1. Objective : Create a simple 4-function calculator.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
first number
operator (+ - * /)
second number


PROCESSING:
declare number1
declare number2

assign numbers to each operating case
perform that operation and only that operation when the case is selected, using number1 and number2

show output describing the calculation that took place, and its result


OUTPUT:
user introduction
result of the calculation, with display of operation

DATA:
number1 // first number entered
number2 // second number entered
operator // number referencing a case to be carried out
result // result of the calculation

3. Instructions
10 declare number1
20 declare number2
30 output user introduction
40 prompt user to input number1
50 store as number1
60 prompt user to input number2
70 store as number2
80 prompt user to input 1, 2, 3, or 4
90 store as operator
100 if operator = 1, add number1 and number2      1 + 2
110 if operator = 2, subtract number2 from number1 1 - 2
120 if operator = 3, multiply number1 and number2 1 * 2
130 if operator = 4, if number2 is zero, output error message and return to instruction 40
135 else divide number1 by number2 1 / 2
140 if operator is not 1, 2, 3, OR 4, output error message and return to instruction 80
150 output a formatted calculation, and output the result.
