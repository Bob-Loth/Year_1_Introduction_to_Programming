1. Objective: encode a user-given text file and save the encoded text as secrets.txt

2. Requirements
INPUT: file named secrets.txt

PROCESSING:
set input and output file stream commands
get user input for a text file to encode
open the file, check for errors and close safely if they occur
open a file called secrets.txt
get a line from file
save the line as a string variable
for all the characters in the string, add 1 to each character's UNICODE value, changing the characters in the string
output the new, encoded string to the console
output the new, encoded string to secrets.txt
repeat, getting the next line and performing the encoding, then output the next line to the console
when all lines are encoded, close secrets.txt
when all lines are encoded, close the original file



OUTPUT: encoded text to the console
        encoded text to a file called secrets.txt

DATA:


3. Instructions
5 create an a list containing the integers -5, 8, 12, 6, and 1
6 create a variable called i that starts at 0 and counts up by 1
7 create a variable called index that is the remainder of i divided by the size of the list (5 i this case).
10 get user input for a text file to encode
15 check for errors and close program if there are errors
16 open the input file
17 open a file called secrets.txt
20 input the first/next line from the input file. if there are no more lines, then skip to instruction 30
22 save line as a string
24 for each character in the string, add the position in the list described by index to its UNICODE value, then save it over the character in the string. When a character is decoded, increase i by 1.
26 output the encoded line/string to the console
27 output the encoded line/string to secrets.txt
28 when there are no more characters in the line/string, return to instruction 20
30 close input file
31 close secrets.txt




4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: Wide variety of characters    and  Input values if any:
Original Text    Encoded Text
asdf qwer        \{fl!l[DEL]qx

1234             ,:?:

5 array {-5, 8, 12, 6, and 1}
6 i=0
7 index = i % 5
10 original.txt
15 original.txt exists and is the correct file type, no errors
16 original.txt is now open
17 secrets.txt is now open
20 input from original.txt: asdf qwer
22 string = asdf qwer
24 a + -5 = \, s + 8 = {, d + 12 = p, f + 6 = l, ' ' + 1 = !, q + -5 = l, w + 8 = [DEL], e + 12 = q, r + 6 = x
26 console: \{fl!l[DEL]qx
27 secrets.txt: \{fl!l[DEL]qx
28 return to instruction 20
20 input from original.txt: no characters on line
22 string = ""
24 no characters in string
26 console: ""
27 secrets.txt: ""
28 return to instruction 20
20 input from original.txt: 1234
22 string = 1234
24 1 + -5 = ,, 2 + 8 = :, 3 + 12 = ?, 4 + 6 = :.
26 console: ,:?:
27 secrets.txt: 2345
28 return to instruction 20
20 skip to instruction 30
30 original.txt is now closed
31 secrets.txt is now closed
