1. Objective:  
reads input temperatures from a text file (named temps.txt) in
the working directory. The file should allow one temperature per line, possibly with decimal
points and digits after the decimal (like 12.34).
2. Requirements:
--INPUT: 
file called temps.txt in the same working directory
--PROCESSING: 
read line from temps.txt
save to a variable
calculate celsius to fahrenheit using that variable
check if a value is -999 before proceeding, end if value is -999
output a closing statement once all temperatures are converted, that states the celsius temperature and fahrenheit temperature
do not format celsius, but format fahrenheit to one digit past decimal point

--OUTPUT:
echoed celsius input, unformatted
returned fahrenheit output, one digit past decimal point

--DATA:
temps.txt , contains temperatures in degrees c all on separate lines
c , temperature in degrees celsius
f , temperature in degrees fahrenheit

3. Algorithm Instructions
10 output introduction
11 create f, for a temperature in degrees fahrenheit
12 create c, for a temperature in degrees celsius
20 open temps.txt
30 if temps.txt is not working correctly, output an I/O error
40 read the first line from temps.txt, save as c
50 set f equal to (9.0/5.0 * c) + 32.0
60 output both c , unformatted, and f, formatted to one past decimal point
70 move console output down a line and repeat instruction 40 for each subsequent line
80 if there are no more lines, close temps.txt and end program


4. Test cases  Expected result f = 89.6, 95.0 104.0, 104.0, and c = 32, 35, 40, 40.005 from initial value c = 32, 35.000, 40.0, 40.005
Checks to see if formatting, math and loop is correct for all expected inputs
10 "Reading from temps.txt. Please ensure that each temp is in degrees C and each is on a separate line. a value of -999 in temps.txt will signal the program to end at that line."
