1. Objective : Create a simple 4-function calculator.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
first number
operator (+ - * /)
second number


PROCESSING:
declare number1
declare number2

assign numbers to each operating case
perform that operation and only that operation when the case is selected, using number1 and number2

show output describing the calculation that took place, and its result


OUTPUT:
user introduction
result of the calculation, with display of operation

DATA:
number1 // first number entered
number2 // second number entered
operator // number referencing a case to be carried out
result // result of the calculation

3. Instructions
10 declare number1
20 declare number2
30 output user introduction
40 prompt user to input number1
50 store as number1
60 prompt user to input number2
70 store as number2
80 prompt user to input 1, 2, 3, or 4
90 store as operator
100 if operator = 1, add number1 and number2      1 + 2
110 if operator = 2, subtract number2 from number1 1 - 2
120 if operator = 3, multiply number1 and number2 1 * 2
130 if operator = 4, if number2 = 0, skip to 135, else divide number1 by number2 1 / 2 then skip to 140
135  output error message and return to instruction 30
140 if operator is not 1, 2, 3, OR 4, output error message and return to instruction 80
150 output a formatted calculation, and output the result.
160 repeat instructions from 30 if there are additional calculations
999 DONE

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: basic addition, multiplication, repeating    and  Input values if any: number1=6 number2=5, second time(multiplication) number1=2 number2=2 Expected Result = 11
10 number1 = 
20 number2 = 
30 This program will perform 4-function calculations on two numbers.
40 Please input number1
50 number1 = 6
60 Please input number2
70 number2 = 5
80 Please enter 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division
90 operator = 1
100 true, result = 6 + 5 = 11
110 false
120 false
130 false
135 false
140 false
150 6 + 5 = 11
160 any additional calculations? y/n  Y
30 This program will perform 4-function calculations on two numbers.
40 Please input number1
50 number1 = 2
60 Please input number2
70 number2= 2
80 Please enter 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division
90 operator = 3
100 false
110 false
120 true, result = 2 * 2 = 4
130 false
135 false
140 false
150 2 * 2 = 4
160 any additional calculations? y/n  N
999 DONE

Test Case#2: What is being tested: divide by 0, or trying to enter invalid operator value  and  Input values if any: number1=6 number2=0 Expected result: error message, then repeat until operator query, then error message
