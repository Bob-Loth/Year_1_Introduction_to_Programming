Track score, do not count ties, and output the numbers of computer wins and human wins after all play ends.
Replay until the human player decides to quit.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
R or r for rock, P or p for paper, S or s for scissors, or Q or q to quit. 
Computer input will be randomly generated (0-rock, 1-paper, 2-scissors).

PROCESSING:
-->>generate a random number between 0 to 2 for computer's choice of rock, paper, or scissors
prompt for userPlay
input userPlay
randomly generate computerPlay
determine winner
output computerPlay and userPlay and who won
if user won, add 1 to userScore, else if computer won, add 1 to computerScore
output computerScore and userScore with appropriate labels
prompt for userPlay

-->>repeat

OUTPUT:
the result of each individual match
the total score

DATA:
userPlay // the user input that determines what hand they throw. Acceptable values R r, P p, S s, for rock paper scissors, or Q q, to quit
computerPlay // randomly generated computer input that simulates an opponent's hand throw.
userScore initial value 0// Total amount of wins for the human player
computerScore initial value 0// Total amount of wins for the computer player


3. Instructions
10 generate a random number between 0 to 2 for computer's choice of rock, paper, or scissors
20 prompt for userPlay
30 input userPlay
40 validate userPlay, if userPlay is Q or q, then go to instruction 500.
41 if userPlay is R,r,P,p,S,s, then continue to instruction 50
42 if userPlay is invalid, display error message, return to instruction 10
50 determine winner: 
51    if computer = r AND user = r , TIE declare a tie, award no points, display current scores then return to instruction 10
52    if computer = r AND user = p , USERWIN give user a point, display current scores then return to instruction 10 
53    if computer = r AND user = s , COMPUTERWIN give computer a point, display current scores then return to instruction 10
54    if computer = p AND user = r , COMPUTERWIN give computer a point, display current scores then return to instruction 10
55    if computer = p AND user = p , TIE declare a tie, award no points, display current scores then return to instruction 10
56    if computer = p AND user = s , USERWIN give user a point, display current scores then return to instruction 10 
57    if computer = s AND user = r , USERWIN give user a point, display current scores then return to instruction 10 
58    if computer = s AND user = p , COMPUTERWIN give computer a point, display current scores then return to instruction 10
59    if computer = s AND user = s , TIE declare a tie, award no points, display current scores then return to instruction 10
500 display the final score
502 if userScore > computerScore, output user win message
503 if userScore < computerScore, output computer win message
504 if userScore = computerScore, declare a tie
505 output "Thanks for playing!"
