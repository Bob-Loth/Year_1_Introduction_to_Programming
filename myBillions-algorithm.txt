1. Objective: Simulate the piggy bank problem, and 
calculate how long it will take to save 1 billion dollars total

2. Requirements
INPUT:
initialAmount - programmer's input at 0.05

PROCESSING:


add initialAmount * 2^(n-1) to amountSaved, where n is the number of weeks 
if amountSaved is less than 1000, assign n to thousandaire
if amountSaved is more than 1,000,000, assign n to millionaire
if amountSaved is more than 1,000,000,000, assign n to billionaire, then go to instruction 100
if amountSaved is less than 1,000,000,000, go back to 10.
display the following:
    In {thousandaire} weeks, I will be a thousandaire!
    In {millionaire} weeks, I will be a millionaire!
    In {billionaire} weeks, I will be a billionaire!


OUTPUT:
thousandaire // time in weeks it would take to save $1000 using this method
millionaire //  time in weeks it would take to save $1,000,000 using this method
billionaire //  time in weeks it would take to save $1,000,000,000 using this method
DATA:


3. Instructions 
1 create a value called amountSaved, set to 0.00
2 create a value called initialAmount, set to 0.05
3 create a value called weeks, set to 1
4 create a value called thousandaire
5 create a value called millionaire
6 create a value called billionaire 
10 add initialAmount * 2^(n-1) to amountSaved, where n is the number of weeks 
20 if amountSaved is less than 1000, assign n to thousandaire
30 if amountSaved is more than 1,000,000, assign n to millionaire
40 if amountSaved is more than 1,000,000,000, assign n to billionaire, then go to instruction 100
50 if amountSaved is less than 1,000,000,000, go back to 10.
100 display the following:
    In {thousandaire} weeks, I will be a thousandaire!
