1. Objective: Decode secrets.txt produced by nsaencoder1.cpp

2. Requirements
INPUT: file named secrets.txt

PROCESSING:
set input and output file stream commands
open secrets.txt, check for errors and close safely if they occur
get a line from secrets.txt
save the line as a string variable
for all the characters in the string, subtract 1 to each character's UNICODE value, changing the characters in the string
output the new, decoded string to the console
repeat, getting the next line and performing the decoding, then output the next line to the console
when all lines are decoded, close secrets.txt




OUTPUT: decoded text to the console

DATA:


3. Instructions
5 create an a list containing the integers -5, 8, 12, 6, and 1
6 create a variable called i that starts at 0 and counts up by 1
7 create a variable called index that is the remainder of i divided by the size of the list (5 i this case).
10 open secret.txt for input
15 check for errors and close program if there are errors
20 input the first/next line from the input file. if there are no more lines, then skip to instruction 30
22 save line as a string
24 for each character in the string, subtract the number in the list described by index to its UNICODE value, then save it over the character in the string
26 output the decoded line/string to the console
28 when there are no more characters in the line/string, return to instruction 20
30 close input file




4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: Wide variety of characters, lines without characters     and  Input values if any: 
encoded text    expected decoded text
\{fl!l[DEL]qx   asdf qwer    
,:?:            1234


\{fl            asdf


10 secret.txt is now open
15 no errors
20 input  \{fl!l[DEL]qx from secrets.txt
22 string = \{fl!l[DEL]qx
24 \ - -5 = a, { - 8 = s, f - 12 = d, l - 6 = f, ! - 1 = ' ', l - -5 = q, [DEL] - 8 = w, q - 12 = e, x - 6 = r
26 asdf qwer
28 return to 20
20 input ,:?: from secrets.txt
22 string = ,:?:
24 , - -5 = 1, : - 8 = 2, ? - 12 = 3, : - 6 = 4
26 1234
28 return to 20
20 input "" from secrets.txt
22 string = ""
24 string of length 0
26 ""
28return to 20
20 input "" from secrets.txt
22 string = ""
24 string of length 0
26 ""
28 return to 20
20 input \{fl from secrets.txt
24 \ - -5 = a, { - 8 = s, f - 12 = d, l - 6 = f
26 asdf
28 no more lines to decode
30 secret.txt is now closed
