1. Objective: to make the user guess a number between 1 and 10, and see if the guess matches the randomly generated number.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
usersGuess : a guess of an integer from 1 to 10


PROCESSING:
create a variable usersGuess to store keyboard input of an integer between 1 and 10
create a randomly generated variable of an integer between 1 and 10
if usersGuess == randomNumber, then show successprompt
elseif (usersGuess < 1 || usersGuess > 10 ) show error message and output valid values prompt
else show failprompt

OUTPUT:
random number
guessPrompt
failPrompt
successPrompt

DATA:
randomNumber
usersGuess

3. Instructions
10 create a variable usersGuess to store keyboard input of an integer between 1 and 10
20 create a randomly generated variable of an integer between 1 and 10
25 ask user to input an integer between 1 and 10, store as usersGuess
30 if usersGuess == randomNumber , go to instruction 60
40 while (usersGuess != randomNumber ) show error message and output valid values prompt, then return to instruction 25
50 else show failprompt, return to instruction 25
60 show successprompt
999 DONE

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: invalid input    and  Input values if any: usersGuess = 90

10 usersGuess =
20 randomNumber = 7, or whichever
25 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. ;  usersGuess = 90
30 false
40 true ; I really want a number between 1 and 10.
25 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. // continued until valid input is given.

Test Case#2: What is being tested:  correct guess  and  Input values if any: usersGuess = 5 = randomNumber
10 usersGuess =
20 randomNumber = 5
25 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. ;  usersGuess = 5
30 true
60 You guessed it!

Test Case#3: What is being tested: incorrect guess    and  Input values if any: usersGuess = 2 != randomNumber
10 usersGuess =
20 randomNumber = 7, or whichever, not 2
25 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. ; usersGuess = 2
30 false
40 false
50 Try again...
25 I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. ; // repeated until correct guess
