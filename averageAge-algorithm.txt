1. Objective: Calculate the average age of everyone in the room.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
age
PeopleCheck

PROCESSING:
1. Tell user what we are going to do (User Introduction).
2. Input each person's age and add it to sum. Count each person.
3. Calculate the average age and output number of people in the room and average age.

OUTPUT:
User Introduction
AgePrompt
PeopleCheckPrompt
NoPeoplePrompt
People1Prompt
People2Prompt

DATA:
age = each person's age [integer measured in years] valid values are 0 to 122. invalid values will return a message with guidance.
count = number of people in the room. Valid values are integers >= 0. 
sum = sum of all ages [integer].
averageAge = average age of all the people in the room [decimal].

3. Instructions
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageAge
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 Output User Introduction "This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average age of everyone in the room."
  15 Output PeopleCheckPrompt "This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)"
  17 input PeopleCheck
  18 if PeopleCheck = y, skip to instruction 20.
  19 if PeopleCheck = n, output NoPeoplePrompt "There is no average age for people in the room if there are no people in the room.", else return to instruction 15.

 20 Output AgePrompt "What is your age in years, rounded down to the nearest whole year? Acceptable inputs [0-122]".
 30 Input age.
 40 If age >= 0 or < 122, then skip to instruction 70. 
50 Output label "Try again. Acceptable values for age are whole numbers 0 through 122"
60 Return to instruction 20.
70 add age to sum.
80 add 1 to count.
90 If there are more people to ask their age, then return to instruction 20.
100 Set averageAge = sum / count
105 Output People1Prompt "There are"
107 Output count
109 Output People2Prompt "people in the room."
110 Output label "The average age of everyone in the room is" 
120 Output averageAge
999 DONE.


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: No people in the room    and  Input values if any: PeopleCheck = n
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageAge
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average age of everyone in the room.
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
17 PeopleCheck = n
19 true , There is no average age for people in the room if there are no people in the room.

999 DONE.

Test Case#2: What is being tested: No people in the room #2    and  Input values if any: PeopleCheck = jjjj
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageAge
4 Set CheckDone=0
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average age of everyone in the room.
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
17 PeopleCheck = jjjj
18 False
19 False
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
Repeated until acceptable input (y or n) is given

Test Case#3: What is being tested:3 people, ages 15, 20, 25 and  Input values if any: PeopleCheck = y age = 15, 20, 25
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageAge=0
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average age of everyone in the room.
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
17 PeopleCheck = y
18 True
20 What is your age in years, rounded down to the nearest whole year? Acceptable inputs [0-122]
30 age = 15
40 True 
70 sum = 0 + 15 = 15
80 count = 0 + 1 = 1
90 True
20 What is your age in years, rounded down to the nearest whole year? Acceptable inputs [0-122]
30 age = 20
40 True
70 sum = 15 + 20 = 35
80 count = 1 + 1 = 2
90 True
20 What is your age in years, rounded down to the nearest whole year? Acceptable inputs [0-122]
30 age = 25
40 True
70 sum = 35 + 25 = 60
80 count = 2 + 1 = 3
90 False
100 averageAge = 60 / 3
105 There are
107 3
109 people in the room.
110 The average age of everyone in the room is 
120 20
999 DONE.
