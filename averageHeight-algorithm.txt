1. Objective: Calculate the average height of everyone in the room.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
height
PeopleCheck

PROCESSING:
1. Tell user what we are going to do (User Introduction).
2. Input each person's height in inches and add it to sum. Count each person.
3. Calculate the average height in inches and output number of people in the room and average height.

OUTPUT:
User Introduction
heightPrompt
PeopleCheckPrompt
NoPeoplePrompt
People1Prompt
People2Prompt
InchesLabel

DATA:
height = each person's height [integer measured in inches] valid values are 20 to 100. invalid values will return a message with guidance.
count = number of people in the room. Valid values are integers >= 0. 
sum = sum of all heights [integer]in inches.
averageheight = average height of all the people in the room [decimal] in inches.

3. Instructions
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageheight=0
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 Output User Introduction "This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average height of everyone in the room."
  15 Output PeopleCheckPrompt "This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)"
  17 input PeopleCheck
  18 if PeopleCheck = y, skip to instruction 20.
  19 if PeopleCheck = n, output NoPeoplePrompt "There is no average height for people in the room if there are no people in the room.", else return to instruction 15.

 20 Output heightPrompt "What is your height in inches, rounded down to the nearest whole inch? Acceptable inputs [20-100]".
 30 Input height.
 40 If height >= 20 or < 100, then skip to instruction 70. 
50 Output label "Try again. Acceptable values for height are whole numbers 20 through 100"
60 Return to instruction 20.
70 add height to sum.
80 add 1 to count.
90 If there are more people to ask their height, then return to instruction 20.
100 Set averageheight = sum / count
105 Output People1Prompt "There are"
107 Output count
109 Output People2Prompt "people in the room."
110 Output label "The average height of everyone in the room is" 
120 Output averageheight
130 Output InchesLabel "inches."
999 DONE.


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: No people in the room    and  Input values if any: PeopleCheck = n
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageheight
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average height of everyone in the room.
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
17 PeopleCheck = n
19 true, There is no average height for people in the room if there are no people in the room.
999 DONE.

Test Case#2: What is being tested: No people in the room #2    and  Input values if any: PeopleCheck = jjjj
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageheight
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average height of everyone in the room.
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
17 PeopleCheck = jjjj
18 False
19 False
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
Repeated until acceptable input (y or n) is given

Test Case#3: What is being tested:3 people, heights 60, 70, 65 and  Input values if any: PeopleCheck = y height = 60, 70, 65
1 Set sum=0
2 Set count=0
3 Set averageheight
5 Set PeopleCheck=n
10 This algorithm is going to be used to calculate the average height of everyone in the room.
15 This algorithm will not work if there are no people in the room. Are there people in the room? (y/n)
17 PeopleCheck = y
18 True
20 What is your height in inches, rounded down to the nearest whole inch? Acceptable inputs [20-100]
30 height = 60
40 True 
70 sum = 0 + 60 = 60
80 count = 0 + 1 = 1
90 True
20 What is your height in inches, rounded down to the nearest whole year? Acceptable inputs [20-100]
30 height = 70
40 True
70 sum = 60 + 70 = 130
80 count = 1 + 1 = 2
90 True
20 What is your height in inches, rounded down to the nearest whole year? Acceptable inputs [20-100]
30 height = 65
40 True
70 sum = 130 + 65 = 195
80 count = 2 + 1 = 3
90 False
100 averageheight = 195 / 3
105 There are
107 3
109 people in the room.
110 The average height of everyone in the room is 
120 65
130 inches.
999 DONE.
