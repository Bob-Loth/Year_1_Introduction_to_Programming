1. Objective: calculate a value in the Fibonacci sequence.

2. Requirements
INPUT: 
-n , a number representing the index in the sequence.
PROCESSING:
prompt user to enter an integer of 0 or greater. Validate the input.

create the fibonacci sequence up to and including that number, where fib[0]=0, fib[1]=1, and 
each value at position fib[n] after fib[0] and fib[1] is the sum of fib [n-1] and fib[n-2]

stop at fib[n], where n is the user's input
output all the numbers created in fib, with label
output the nth number in fib, with label
OUTPUT: 
all the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to and including the sequence number, with label 
the Fibonacci number corresponding to the sequence number input, with label.

DATA:
fib, a list of the fibonacci numbers up to the (n+1)th value

3. Instructions

***prompt user to enter an integer of 0 or greater. Validate the input.***
10 prompt user to input an integer, which will represent the position of a value in the fibonacci sequence.
20 if the integer is <0, or not an integer, send error message and prompt user to enter valid value, go back to 10
***create the fibonacci sequence***
30 Base cases are fib[0]=0, fib[1]=1. All other numbers are the sum of fib [n-1] and fib[n-2]. 
40 create n+1 fibonacci numbers and add them to a list, using the above formula.
***stop at fib[n], where n is the user's input***
40 (continued) when fib[n] is reached, where n is the user's input, stop creating additional fibonacci numbers.
***output***
50 output all the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to and including the sequence number, with label 
60 output the Fibonacci number corresponding to the sequence number input, with label.






4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: n=4, basic case    Input values if any: n=4
Expected output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.  fib[4]= 3.

10 Please enter an integer between 0 and 40.
This program will calculate the fibonacci number corresponding to its position: 
user entered 4, n=4
20 false
30 fib[0] = 0 fib[1] = 1 
40 fib[2] = fib[2-1] + fib[2-2] = 1 - 0 = 1. fib[3] = fib[2] + fib[1] = 1 + 1 = 2
fib[4] = fib[3] + fib[2] = 2 + 1 = 3.
40(continued) n=4, fib[4] was reached, stop creating more numbers
50 Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
60 the 4th Fibonacci number is 3.

Test Case#2 What is being tested: negative input  Input values if any: n-1
Expected output: invalid, do not calculate

10 Please enter an integer between 0 and 40.
This program will calculate the fibonacci number corresponding to its position: 
user entered -1, n=-1
20 true, Values must be positive integers, including 0. go back to 10.
10 Please enter an integer between 0 and 40.
continued until valid value is entered.

Test Case#3 What is being tested: n = 1  Input values if any: n=1
Expected output: No calculations, just stating the base cases
10 Please enter an integer between 0 and 40. n = 1
20 false
30 fib[0] = 0 fib[1] = 1 
40 2 fibonacci numbers exist, fib[0] and fib[1]
40(continued) fib[1] was reached, stop calculations
50 Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1
60 the 2nd Fibonacci number is 1.
