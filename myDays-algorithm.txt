INPUT:

1994-2018
1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 - 6 leap years

A. the number of years in which you've lived, including your birth year and the current year - 24 years, or 8760 days : days
B. the number of leap years in your life - 1994-2018 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 - 6 leap years : leapDays
C. the number of days in your birth year before you were born, including your day of birth - 363 days : daysBefore
D. the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date for this lab, excluding that date. - 190 days : daysAfter



PROCESSING: 

set the value days to 0
Add to "days" the result of this multiplication: 365 times the number of years
in which you've lived.
Add to "days" the number of those years that were leap years.
Subtract from "days" the number of days in your birth year before you were
born.
Subtract from "days" the number of days remaining in the current year after the
due date.
Output the value of "days" with an appropriate label.


OUTPUT: How many days old I will be by the due date of this assignment.


DATA:

A. the number of years in which you've lived, including your birth year and the current year - 25 years, or
B. the number of leap years in your life - 1994-2018
1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 - 6 leap years
C. the number of days in your birth year before you were born, including your day of birth - 362 days
D. the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date for this lab, excluding that date. - 190 days

3. Instructions

1 Assign number of years in which you have lived, including your birth year AND current year - years
2 Assign number of leap years in your life - leapDays
3 Assign number of days in your birth year before you were born, including your day of birth - daysBefore 
10 Multiply years by 365, store as days1
20 Add leapDays to days1, store as days2
30 Subtract daysBefore from days2, store as days3
40 Subtract 190 from days3, store as Age
50 Output, in 3 separate lines, your date of birth, the due date, and Age, with appropriate labels.




4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: For Test case DOB = 12/29/1994  and  Input values if any: years = 25 (1994-2018), leapDays = 6 daysBefore = 363 
Expected results from http://www.timeanddate.com/date/duration.html : 8578 days, not including end date

1 years      = 25
2 leapDays   = 6
3 daysBefore = 363
10 days1 = years * 365        = 25 * 365   = 9125
20 days2 = leapDays + days1   = 9125 + 6   = 9131
30 days3 = days2 - daysBefore = 9131 - 363 = 8768
40 age   = days3 - 190        = 8768 - 190 = 8578
50 DOB: 12/29/1994
   Due: 6/24/2018
   age: 8578 days

Test case#2: What is being tested: For test case 4/1/1992 and Input values if any: years = 27 (1992-2018), leapDays = 7 daysBefore = 92
Expected results from http://www.timeanddate.com/date/duration.html : 9580 days, not including end date

1 years      = 27
2 leapDays   = 7
3 daysBefore = 92
10 days1 = years * 365        = 27 * 365   = 9855
20 days2 = leapDays + days1   = 9855 + 7   = 9862
30 days3 = days2 - daysBefore = 9862 - 92  = 9770
40 age   = days3 - daysAfter  = 9770 - 190 = 9580
50 DOB: 12/29/1994
   Due: 4/1/2018
   age: 9580 days
