1. Objective: modify mort3.cpp by replacing its separate variables with a single object with data fields that replace the variables.

2. Requirements:
--INPUT
amount borrowed ; user input in dollars
interest rate ; user input of decimal monthly interest rate
payback period ; programmer's input in years

--PROCESSING
ask for password
lock/unlock program
get input data
perform mortgage calculation

--OUTPUT
monthly payment, amount paid monthly to pay off mortgage in dollars

--Data
amount borrowed
interest rate
payback period
monthly payment
3. Algorithm instructions
10 create a structure with fields for interestRate, monthlyPayment, amountBorrowed, and years
20 set a password
30 ask user to enter the password
40 if the user correctly enters the password then go to step 70
50 if the user incorrectly enters the password, then go to step 30 a maximum of 5 times
60 if the the user incorrectly enters password more than 5 times, close program
70 ask for total amount in dollars that was borrowed, save as amountBorrowed in structure
80 ask for the annual decimal interest rate, divide it by 12 and save as interestRate in structure
90 calculate using amortization formula found on exercise 5.1
100 output amountBorrowed, formatted interest rate, and the monthly repayment amount
END

4. Test Cases
Test Case #1: input values = amountBorrowed=270000 interestRate = .05125 Expected results = monthlyPayment = 1411
10 struct { interestRate, monthlyPayment, amountBorrowed,years}
20 password = 1684749
30 "enter password"
40 userPassword = password true
70 "what is the total amount in dollars borrowed?" amountBorrowed=270000
80 "what is the annual decimal interest rate?" interestRate = .05125 / 12 = .004270833
90 calculation yields 1470.11 = monthlyPayment
100 Borrowing 270000, at 5.125% annual interest, requires a monthly payment of $1470.11
END

Test Case #1: input values = invalid password expected results: close program
10 struct { interestRate, monthlyPayment, amountBorrowed,years}
20 password = 1684749
30 "enter password"
40 userPassword = password false
50 true, go to step 30 count 1
60 false
30 "enter password"
40 userPassword = password false
50 true, go to step 30 count 2
60 false
30 "enter password"
40 userPassword = password false
50 true, go to step 30 count 3
60 false
30 "enter password"
40 userPassword = password false
50 true, go to step 30 count 4
60 false
30 "enter password"
40 userPassword = password false
50 true, go to step 30 count 5
60 false
30 "enter password"
40 userPassword = password false
50 true, go to step 30 count 6
60 true, close program
