1. Objective : to receive 4 inputs about a person through keyboard input, and output sentences about those inputs in a sentence using labels.

2. Requirements
INPUT: 
height of lighthouse in feet, double: height


PROCESSING:
prompt user to input height of lighthouse in feet
take keyboard input
store as height
perform calculation on height
store result as the distance in miles a boat can see a lighthouse
output result in readable format 


OUTPUT:
distance in miles from which a boat can see a lighthouse 

DATA:
height
distance


3. Instructions
5 declare height
7 declare distance
10 output user introduction
20 prompt to input the height of decimal feet
30 store input as height
40 perform calculation on height ( multiply by 0.8, then take sqrt of result), store result as distance
50 output result, accompanied by descriptive label and units.
999 DONE


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: What is being tested: integer input   and  Input values if any: height = 125 (feet) Expected result: distance = 10 miles
5 height = 
7 distance = 
10 This program will calculate the distance, in miles, from which a boat can see a lighthouse, based on the lighthouses height, in feet.
20 Please enter the lighthouse's height, in decimal feet: 
30 height = [125]
40 distance = sqrt( 0.8 * 125 )
50 A lighthouse that is [125] feet tall will provide light to boats that are up to [10] miles away.
999 DONE

Test Case#1: What is being tested: decimal input   and  Input values if any: height = 125.000001 (feet) Expected result: distance = 10 miles

5 height = 
7 distance = 
10 This program will calculate the distance, in miles, from which a boat can see a lighthouse, based on the lighthouses height, in feet.
20 Please enter the lighthouse's height, in decimal feet: 
30 height = [125.0]
40 distance = sqrt( 0.8 * 125.000001 )
50 A lighthouse that is [125.000] feet tall will provide light to boats that are up to [10] miles away.
999 DONE

Test Case#2 : What is being tested: in class test case and  Input values if any: height = 100.001 (feet) Expected result: distance = 9 miles

5 height = 
7 distance = 
10 This program will calculate the distance, in miles, from which a boat can see a lighthouse, based on the lighthouses height, in feet.
20 Please enter the lighthouse's height, in decimal feet: 
30 height = [100.001]
40 distance = sqrt( 0.8 * 100.001 )
50 A lighthouse that is [100.001] feet tall will provide light to boats that are up to [9] miles away.
999 DONE
